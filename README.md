- ## Using Dynamic Programming

    - ### Intuition
        - The goal is to find the maximum number of moves that can be made in a grid, starting from any cell in the first column, while only moving to cells with strictly greater values in the specified directions (down-right, right, and up-right). We can utilize dynamic programming to efficiently compute the maximum moves for each cell by building upon previously computed results.

    - ## Approach
        1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create a DP table (`no_of_Moves`) where each cell represents the maximum number of moves that can be made starting from that cell.
        2. **Reverse Iteration**: Iterate through the grid from the second last column to the first column. This allows us to compute the maximum moves for each cell based on the adjacent cells in the next column.
        3. **Direction Exploration**: For each cell, check possible moves to adjacent cells. If the move is valid (the adjacent cell has a strictly greater value), update the DP table with the maximum moves possible.
        4. **Result Extraction**: After populating the DP table, find the maximum value in the first column, which represents the maximum moves starting from any cell in that column.

    - ### Time Complexity
        - **O(N * M)**: We iterate through each cell in the grid (N rows and M columns) and check a fixed number of directions (constant time operations), resulting in a linear complexity relative to the size of the grid.

    - ### Space Complexity
        - **O(N * M)**: The DP table requires storage proportional to the number of cells in the grid (N * M), where each entry stores the maximum moves from that cell.

    - ### Code
        ```python3 []
        class Solution:
            def maxMoves(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
                # Get the number of rows and columns in the grid
                total_Rows, total_Columns = len(grid), len(grid[0])
                
                # Define possible directions of movement: down-right, right, and up-right
                directions = [(-1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1)]
                
                # Initialize a 2D list to store the number of moves from each cell
                no_of_Moves = [[0] * total_Columns for _ in range(total_Rows)]

                # Iterate through the grid in reverse order (bottom-up)
                for column in range(total_Columns - 2, -1, -1):
                    for row in range(total_Rows):
                        best_Choice = 0  # Initialize the best choice for the current position
                        
                        # Explore each possible direction
                        for dr, dc in directions:
                            new_row, new_column = row + dr, column + dc
                            
                            # Check if the next position is valid and has a strictly greater value
                            if (0 <= new_row < total_Rows and
                                0 <= new_column < total_Columns and
                                grid[new_row][new_column] > grid[row][column]):
                                best_Choice = max(best_Choice, 1 + no_of_Moves[row + dr][column + dc])
                        
                        # Store the best choice (maximum moves) for the current cell
                        no_of_Moves[row][column] = best_Choice

                max_Moves = 0  # Variable to track the maximum moves found
                # Iterate through the first column to find the maximum moves possible
                for row in range(total_Rows):
                    max_Moves = max(max_Moves, no_of_Moves[row][0])

                # Return the maximum moves found
                return max_Moves
        ```
